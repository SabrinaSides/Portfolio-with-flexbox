              <h3>Hello there!</h3>
              <p>My name is Sabrina and I'm a software developer living in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.</p>
              <p>I recently made my career change from ICU nurse to software developer. While the switch may seem dramatic, I've found that my curiousity, willingness to learn, attention to detail and innovation have helped my transition. Please continue browsing my webpage to see how I've grown. </p>

          <h3>About Me:</h3>
          <p>It took the isolation of a global pandemic to help me fully understand and appreciate how much technology affects our health, happiness and everyday life. Technology gives us the capability to explore the world, express our creativity, challenge ourselves and connect with others all from our livingroom couch. As a software developer, I am eager to learn and collaborate with others to continue making the world a bigger and better place. </p>

          <!--update this paragraph as I gain more language experience-->
          <p>I have developed projects using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I am constantly working on adding more languages and skills to my repetoire. I can contribute to your company using my front-end expertise as I continue to develop my full-stack knowledge.</p>

          <p>During my time away from the computer, I really enjoy adventuring with my husband. Our adventures include:

              <li>Cruising around town on our OneWheels</li>
              <li>Trying out new coffee shops and local restaurants</li>
              <li>Camping and enjoying nature</li>
              </ul>
          <p>...and watching plenty of Youtube and Netflix.</p>
